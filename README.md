# Heart-Disease-Classification
Heart-Disease Classification is a Machine Learning Classification type project.
As in ML , we all know that There are various steps to build a perfect machine learning model.  
  * Problem Definition
  * Data Collection
  * Analysis
  * Features
  * Modelling 
  * Experimentation
  
In this project , we are given a csv file of patients attributes like age. sex, thalach. etc.  through which we have to predict which patients have most chances of having heart disease.
Data Science tools like :
   * Numpy
   * Pandas 
   * Matplotlib 
   * Searborn 
   .......are used for data analysis.
   
Machine Learning models like
   * Random Forest
   * Logistic Regresiion
   * KNeighbors Classifier
   .......are used for predicting the accuracy or target percentage ( chances of having heart disease).
